## Hey! I'm Haley.

I'm a fresh-faced developer having just finished Le Wagon's two-month bootcamp. Before that, I was learning through Harvard's free computer science course: CS50. I've been living in and around Tokyo for 6 years now, and I'm currently job hunting!

My next project is a perfumery formulation app.

Check out my and my wonderful teammates' work below! If you want to know more, why not reach out? c:
